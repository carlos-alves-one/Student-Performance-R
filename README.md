# Project Title

Predictive Modeling of Academic Success: Insights from Regression Analysis

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using various statistical models. The dataset includes age, travel time, family relationship quality, alcohol consumption, absences, and previous grade performances to understand their impact on final grades (G3).

## Files Description

- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages required to run the project's code.
- `student.txt`: Contains information on the dataset and its attributes.
- `student-mat.csv` & `student-por.csv`: Datasets representing student grades in mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively.
- `student-merge.R`: R script for merging the mathematics and Portuguese datasets.
- `Regression_CW1.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook detailing the regression analysis conducted, including data exploration, model development, and validation.
- `carlos_alves_cdeol003_report.pdf`: A comprehensive report on the regression analysis, including insights and conclusions on the models used and their performance.
- `LICENSE`: The license file specifying the terms under which the project can be used or distributed.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python and R are installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. R scripts can be run using an R environment or RStudio.

## Usage

- The Jupyter notebook (`Regression_CW1.ipynb`) can be viewed or run to replicate the analysis steps and results.
- The R script (`student-merge.R`) merges the datasets for a comprehensive analysis.
